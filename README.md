# a-dss-for-extracting-ai-driven-insights-on-natural-disaster

Under the heading "Decision Support Systems for Extracting Artificial Intelligence-Driven Insights in Natural Disasters," this project seeks to examine how rationalisation and strategy for responding to natural disasters can be informed by AI-driven insights from social media data, especially Twitter. Extracting and handling textual data is a critical phase in this endeavour.

•	Dataset Collection: The main objective is to collect a comprehensive representative dataset of tweets about natural disasters. These data sets will serve as the foundation for extracting valuable insights through sentiment analysis and other AI-enabled techniques.

•	Data Preprocessing: A number of methods will be applied in order to get significant insights from the Twitter dataset after it has been received. The main goal will be to extract context, feelings, and patterns from social media data. 

•	ML algorithm technique selection: The project will choose the prediction model with the best accuracy after comparing the models in order to support the sentiment of tweets. 

•	Application of machine learning techniques: Sort the gathered data according to machine learning techniques, assessing the outcomes based on precision and sensory memory criteria. Finding the best framework for sentiment analysis of tweets on natural catastrophes is the aim. 

•	Predicting Reliability and Efficiency: The ultimate aim is to develop a decision support system capable of predicting the efficiency of the sentiment analysis process on Twitter during natural disasters. This system will contribute to reducing the number of failed predictions, providing advanced insights into potential issues, and offering corrective measures for more effective disaster response strategies.
